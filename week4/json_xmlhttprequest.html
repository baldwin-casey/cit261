<button onclick="getbandconditions()">Get Band Conditions</button><br>
Explanation: I am into ham radio, and it is important to know which radio bands have the most favorable conditions. This simply checks an RSS feed/XML feed from http://www.hamqsl.com/solar.html. The owner has asked that this does not refresh every request. So I set up a time limit.

Disclaimer: I was not able to implement this in a way I wanted due to same domain policy, in order to do this correctly, I would use a web scraper and JQuery.
<script>
function getbandconditions() {
var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhttp.open("GET", "solarxml.xml", true);
xhttp.send();
document.getElementById("conditions").innerHTML = xhttp.responseText;
}

</script>
